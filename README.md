# Super Bowl Data Analysis

## Project Description

The Super Bowl Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing television data related to Super Bowl events. The project utilizes data manipulation and visualization techniques to gain insights into various aspects such as game results, audience viewership, and halftime performances.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **Notebook:** The analysis.ipynb notebook contains the detailed analysis of the Super Bowl data. It provides step-by-step explanations of the data manipulation and visualization techniques used.

- **Data Folder:** The data folder contains the datasets used in the analysis. It includes relevant Super Bowl data files in CSV format.

- **Streamlit App:** The streamlit_super_bowl_app.py file contains the source code for a Streamlit application. The application allows users to interactively explore the Super Bowl data and visualize the findings. The deployed app can be accessed through the following link: [Super Bowl Data Analysis App](https://atimla-super-bowl-data-analysis.streamlit.app/).

- **Requirements:** The requirements.txt file lists all the necessary packages and dependencies required to run the Streamlit app.

## Usage
